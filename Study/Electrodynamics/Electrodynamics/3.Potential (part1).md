# 1.Laplace’s Equation
In space where the charge density $\rho=0$﻿ , the potential satisfy **Laplace’s Equation**
$$\nabla^2V=0$$
The solution of Laplace’s equation is called **harmonic function**
The harmonic functions have two important properties:
1. **The maximum principle**: $V$﻿ has no local maxima or minima.(Laplace’s equation picks out the smoothest functions)
2. **The mean value property**: The value of $V$﻿ at the point $\mathbf{x}$﻿ is equivalent to the average of $V$﻿ on a spherical shell center at $\mathbf{x}$﻿.
## 1.1 Laplace’s Equation in One Dimension
Suppose $V$﻿ only depend on one variable $x$﻿ , Laplace’s equation reduces to
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2V}{\mathrm{d}x^2}=0$$
The general solution of it is
$$V=ax+b$$
This is a linear function , and $a$﻿ & $b$﻿ are fixed by the boundary condition.
**Properties**:  
(1).  
$$V(x)=\frac{1}{2}(V(x-x_0)+V(x+x_0))$$
(2).$V$﻿ has no local maxima or minima except the boundary.(obverse in on dimension)
## 1.2 Laplace’s Equation in two dimension
In cartesian coordinate , Laplace’s equation in two dimension is expressed as
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2V}{\mathrm{d}x^2}+\frac{\mathrm{d}^2V}{\mathrm{d}y^2}=0$$
This is a second-order partial differential equation , and it has no “general solution”.
Geometric example: Stretch a rubber sheet over some support , and the height $H(x,y)$﻿ of the sheet over the point $(x,y)$﻿ is a solution of Laplace’s equation.
**Properties**:  
(1).  
$$V(x,y)=\frac{1}{2\pi R}\oint_LV\mathrm{d}l$$
(2).$V$﻿ has no local maxima or minima except the boundary.
## 1.3 Laplace’s Equation in Three Dimension
$$\nabla^2V=0$$
**Properties**:  
(1).  
$$V(\vec{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi R^2}\oint_SV\mathrm{d}s$$
(2).$V$﻿ has no local maxima or minima except the boundary.
**Comprehension of the maximum principle**:  
The principle indicates that  
$\nabla V\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{l}$﻿ can’t remain positive or negative when the direction of $\mathrm{d}\vec{l}$﻿ changed.  
This property is concluded as  
**Earnshaw’s Theorem**: A charge particle can’t be held in stable equilibrium by electric force only.
## 1.4 Boundary condition and Uniqueness Theorem
**First uniqueness theorem**:  
The solution of Laplace’s equation in a volume is uniquely determined if  
$V$﻿ is specified on the boundary surface $S$﻿.

$proof$﻿: Suppose there are two solutions of Laplace’s equation $V_1,V_2$﻿
$$\nabla^2V_1=\nabla^2V_2=0$$

Assume $V_3=V_1-V_2$﻿ , thus
$$\nabla^2V_3=\nabla^2V_1-\nabla^2V_2=0$$

Because the value of $V$﻿ on the boundary is specified , $V_1=V_2$﻿ on the boundary.  
Therefore ,  
$V_3=0$﻿ on the boundary.  
Simultaneously ,  
$V_3$﻿ satisfies the maximum principle. So $V_3\equiv0$﻿ in the volume.
$$V_1=V_2$$
The solution is uniquely determined.
**In addition**:  
Even if there are some charges distributed in the region , the theorem is still held.(just turn Laplace’s equation into Poisson’s equation)  

**Corollary**:  
The potential in a volume is uniquely determined if the two conditions below are specified  
(a).the charge density throughout the region  
(b).the value of  $V$﻿ on the boundary surface
## 1.5 Conductor and the Second Uniqueness Theorem
![[Study/数学分析/手写笔记/Untitled.png]]
**Second uniqueness theorem**:  
In a volume surrounded by conductors and containing a specified charge density  
$\rho$﻿ , the electric field is uniquely determined if the total charge of each conductor is given.

$proof$﻿: Suppose there are two field satisfies the condition $\vec{E}_1,\vec{E}_2$﻿
$$\nabla\cdot \vec{E}_1=\nabla\cdot\vec{E}_2=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$
Assume $\vec{E}_3=\vec{E}_1-\vec{E}_2$﻿ , thus
$$\nabla\cdot\vec{E}_3=0$$
Therefore , according to Gauss’s law
$$\oint_S\vec{E}_3\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{s}=\int_V\nabla\cdot\vec{E}_3\ \mathrm{d}\tau=0$$
Assume the potential of $\vec{E}_3$﻿ is $V_3$﻿. Invoking product rule
$$\nabla\cdot(V_3\vec{E}_3)=V_3\nabla\cdot\vec{E}_3+\vec{E}_3\cdot\nabla V_3=-E_3^2$$
Calculate the integral $\int_V\nabla\cdot(V_3\vec{E}_3)\mathrm{d}\tau$﻿ in the volume
$$\int_V\nabla\cdot(V_3\vec{E}_3)\mathrm{d}\tau=\oint_SV_3\vec{E}_3\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{s}=-\int_VE_3^2\mathrm{d}\tau$$
Each conductor is an equipotential. Assume the potential of $i$﻿th conductor is $V_{3(i)}$﻿ which is a constant on the surface. Therefore
$$\oint_SV_3\vec{E}_3\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{s}=\sum_iV_{3(i)}\oint_{Si}\vec{E}_3\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{s}=0$$
Thus
$$\int_VE_3^2\mathrm{d}\tau=0$$
From this equation , we can solve that $E_3=0$﻿ everywhere in the volume.$\Rightarrow E_1=E_2$﻿  
The electric field is uniquely determined.  
# 2.The Method of Image
## 2.1 The Classic Image Problem
**Theoretical basis**: The uniqueness theorem guarantee if only we find a field satisfying Poisson’s equation and the boundary condition , it’s the real and unique solution.  
The method of image is actually guessing the field which satisfies the conditions.  

Take the simplest problem as an example: a point charge $q$﻿ is held a distance $d$﻿ above a infinite grounded conducting plane.  
The boundary condition of the system is that:  
$V=0$﻿ on the plane and at the infinity.

Now consider a system of two point charges at a distance $2d$﻿ which have the same magnitude and opposite sign. For this system , $V=0$﻿ on the midplane and at the infinity (satisfy the boundary condition mentioned above). So the field in the half space with the positive is what we need.

Quantitatively , suppose the conducting plane is place in $(x,y)$﻿plane and the position of $q$﻿ is $(0,0,d)$﻿
![[Untitled 1.png]]

$$\begin{align}V&=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left(\frac{1}{r_+}-\frac{1}{r_-}\right)\notag\\&=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-d)^2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z+d)^2}}\right)\notag\end{align}$$
## 2.2 Induced Surface Charges
On the surface , the surface charge density is determined by
$$\sigma=-\epsilon_0\frac{\partial V}{\partial n}$$
For the potential solved in 2.1
$$\sigma=-\epsilon_0\left.\frac{\partial V}{\partial n}\right|_{z=0}=-\frac{qd}{2\pi(r^2+d^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\quad\text{where}\ r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$$
Compute the total induced charge
$$\begin{align}Q&=\int\sigma\mathrm{d}s=-\int_0^{\infty}\frac{qd}{2\pi(r^2+d^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\cdot2\pi r\cdot\mathrm{dr}\notag\\&=-q\notag\end{align}$$
Discussion: Exploit Gauss’s theorem , we can also get the answer (take the plane and the half infinity as the integral surface)
## 2.3 Force and Energy
The force exert on $q$﻿ by the induced charges is equivalent to that generated by the image charge
$$F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\cdot\frac{q}{(2d)^2}$$
We can check the answer by integrate the force acting on the plane (per unit area $f=\frac{\sigma^2}{2\epsilon_0}$﻿)
It is already computed that the energy of two point charges
$$W'=-\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\cdot\frac{q^2}{2d}\quad\text{(distented 2d)}$$
Therefore , it’s explicit that the energy of the system is half of $W'$﻿ since only having the “half” field.
$$W=-\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\cdot\frac{q^2}{4d}$$
From another aspect , we can compute the work needed done to move $q$﻿ from infinity to d.
**Simple rules**: the energy between real change and image charge is half of that between real charges , and there is no energy between image charges.
## 2.4 Other Image Problems
Although it’s convenient for us to solve the field with the method of image , there are only a few special systems can we find the image charges (guess the field).
Another common system is a grounded conducting spherical shell with charges outer or inner.  
Consider the simplest condition , a point charge  
$q$﻿ is at a distance $a$﻿ from the spherical center.
![[Untitled 2.png]]
For this system , the electric field outside the shell can be seen as the field produced by two point charges $q\ \&\ q'$﻿ ($q'$﻿ is a image charge placed on the line connecting $q$﻿ and the center).  
Exploit the spherical shell is an equipotential and the value is 0 , we can solve  
$$\begin{cases}q=-\frac{R}{a}q\\b=\frac{R^2}{a}\end{cases}$$
