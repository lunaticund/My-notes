# 1.The Electric Field
## 1.1 The Fundamental Problem
Solve out the force on $Q$﻿ (the text charge) exerted by a sequence of source charges $q_1,q_2,\cdots$﻿
**The principle of superposition**:
$$\vec{F}=\vec{F_1}+\vec{F_2}+\cdots$$
## 1.2 Coulomb’s Law
For two point charges , the force between them is determined by **Coulomb’s Law**
$$
\vec{F}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\cdot\frac{q\ Q}{r^2}\ \hat{r}
$$
$\epsilon_0$﻿ is called as the permittivity of free space.
## 1.3 The Electric Field
Applying Coulomb’s Law
$$\vec{F}=\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\cdot\left(\frac{q_1}{r_1^2}+\frac{q_2}{r_2^2}+\cdots\right)=Q\cdot \vec{E}$$
$\vec{E}(\vec{r})$﻿ is determined by the configuration of the source charges.
## 1.4 Continuous Charge Distribution
Summation$\rightarrow$﻿Integration
$$\vec{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\frac{\rho(\vec{r'})}{(\vec{r}-\vec{r'})^3}\cdot(\vec{r}-\vec{r'})\cdot\mathrm{d}\tau$$
# 2.The Divergence and Curl of Electric Field
## 2.1 Flux and Gauss’s Law
**The flux of electric field:**
$$\phi=\int_S\vec{E}\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{s}$$
According to the model of field line , we can get **Gauss’s Law**
$$\oint_S\vec{E}\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{s}=\int_V\frac{\rho(\vec{r})}{\epsilon_0}\cdot\mathrm{d}\tau$$
Applying the divergence theorem
$$\oint_S\vec{E}\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{s}=\int_V(\nabla\cdot\vec{E})\mathrm{d}\tau$$
Thus
$$\nabla\cdot\vec{E}=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$
This formulation is called Gauss’s law in differential form.
## 2.2 The Divergence of $\vec{E}$﻿
We can attach the divergence using Coulomb’s law directly.
$$\begin{align}\nabla\cdot\vec{E}&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{\vec{r}-\vec{r'}}{(\vec{r}-\vec{r'})^3}\right)\cdot\rho(\vec{r'})\ \mathrm{d}\tau'\notag\\&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\rho(\vec{r'})\cdot\delta^3(\vec{r'})\ \mathrm{d}\tau'\notag\\&=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\notag\end{align}$$
## 2.3 Applying Gauss’s Law
Gauss’s law is always true , but convenient only if some symmetry is permitted.
$$\begin{cases}\mathrm{Sherical\ symmetry}\\\mathrm{Cylinder\ symmetry}\\\mathrm{Plane \ symmetry}\end{cases}$$
## 2.4 The Curl of $\vec{E}$﻿
For a point charge:
$$\vec{E}=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}\hat{r}$$
In spherical coordinate
$$\mathrm{d}\vec{l}=\mathrm{d}r\hat{r}+r\mathrm{d}\theta\hat{\theta}+r\sin{\theta}\mathrm{d}\phi\hat{\phi}$$
Thus
$$\int_a^b\vec{E}\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{l}=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left(\frac{1}{r_a}-\frac{1}{r_b}\right)$$
The integral is independent of the path. According to the conclusion in vector analysis
$$\nabla\times\vec{E}=0$$
For an arbitrary field , applying the principle of superposition
$$\nabla\times\vec{E}=\nabla\times\vec{E}_1+\nabla\times\vec{E}_2+\cdots=0$$
# 3.Electric Potential
## 3.1 Electric Potential
Owing to $\nabla\times\vec{E}=0$﻿
Applying Stokes’s Theorem
$$\vec{E}=-\nabla V$$
The integral form:
$$V(b)-V(a)=-\int_a^b\vec{E}\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{l}$$
Any constant can be add to $V$﻿ (only changes the reference point)
## 3.2 Comments on Potential
omit
## 3.3 Poisson’s Equation and Laplace’s Equation
According to
$$\nabla\cdot\vec{E}=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\\\vec{E}=\nabla V$$
Combined
$$\nabla^2V=-\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$
This is know as **Poisson’s Equation**.
In the regions where $\rho=0$﻿ , the equation reduces to Laplace’s Equation:
$$\nabla^2V=0$$
## 3.4 The Potential of a Localized Charge Distribution
Similar to how we solve out the electric field of a continuous charge distribution , applying principle of superposition
$$V=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\frac{\rho(\vec{r}')}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r'}|}\ \mathrm{d}\tau'$$
This is a solution of Poisson’s Equation.
**Attention:** The result is based on a fundamental assumption: setting the reference point at infinity
## 3.5 Boundary Condition
The boundary condition at a surface with $\sigma$﻿ as the surface charge density
$$E_{\mathrm{out}}^{\bot}-E_{\mathrm{in}}^{\bot}=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}\\E_{\mathrm{out}}^{\parallel}=E_{\mathrm{in}}^{\parallel}$$
Combined into vector form
$$\vec{E}_{\mathrm{out}}-\vec{E}_{\mathrm{in}}=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}\hat{n}$$
As $\hat{n}$﻿ is the normal unit vector of the surface.
Simultaneously , the boundary condition can be expressed with potential
$$V_{\mathrm{out}}=V_{\mathrm{in}}\\\frac{\partial V_{\mathrm{out}}}{\partial n}-\frac{\partial V_{\mathrm{in}}}{\partial n}=-\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}$$
# 4.Work and Energy in Electrostatics
## 4.1 The Work to Move
To move a test charge $Q$﻿ from a to b
$$W=-Q\int_a^b\vec{E}\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{l}=Q(V(b)-V(a))$$
If we move a charge from infinity to $\vec{r}$﻿
$$W=Q\ V(\vec{r})$$
In this sense , the potential is potential energy itself.
## 4.2 The Energy of a Point Charge Distribution
To construct a configuration of point charges , the total work
$$W=\frac{1}{8\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_i\sum_{j\neq i}\frac{q_iq_j}{r_{ij}}$$
The answer is independent of the order to assemble the charges.  
With the potential of point charge , the formulation can be reduced to  
$$W=\frac{1}{2}\sum_iq_i\ V_i$$
$V_i$﻿ is the potential produced by all the other charges except $q_i$﻿
## 4.3 The Energy of a Continuous Charge Distribution
For a volume charge density $\rho$﻿
$$W=\frac{1}{2}\int\rho\ V\ \mathrm{d}\tau$$
Applying Gauss’s Law $\rho=\epsilon_0\nabla\cdot\vec{E}$﻿
$$W=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\int\nabla\cdot\vec{E}\ V\mathrm{d}\tau$$
Simultaneously
$$\begin{align}V\ \nabla\cdot\vec{E}&=\nabla\cdot(V\vec{E})-E\cdot\nabla V\notag\\&=\nabla\cdot(V\vec{E})+E^2\notag\end{align}$$
Thus
$$\begin{align}W&=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\int\left(\nabla\cdot(V\vec{E})+E^2\right)\mathrm{d}\tau\notag\\&=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\left(\int E^2\mathrm{d}\tau+\oint V\vec{E}\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{s}\right)\notag\end{align}$$
The original integral only contains the region where $\rho\neq0$﻿ , but after the transformation the domain can be any region which traps all the charges.  
When we take the all space as the integral domain , the value of the second part become zero  
$$W=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\int E^2\mathrm{d}\tau$$
## 4.4 Comments on Electric Energy
1. $W=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\int E^2\mathrm{d}\tau$﻿ implies that the energy is always positive. But according to the original formulation , the energy can be negative.  
    As for the reason , the original formulation doesn’t take into account the energy to fabricate the point charge.(point charge is an ideal model , and we can only calculate their interacting energy)  
$$\begin{cases}W=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\int E^2\mathrm{d}\tau\quad\text{adopted to continuous charge}\\W=\frac{1}{2}\sum q_iV_i\quad\text{adopted to point charges}\end{cases}$$
2. According to $W=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\int E^2\mathrm{d}\tau$﻿ , the energy is stored in the electric field.  
    However ,  
    $W=\frac{1}{2}\int \rho V\mathrm{d}\tau$﻿ indicate that the energy is stored in the charges.
3. The superposition principle
$$\vec{E}=\vec{E}_1+\vec{E}_2\\\begin{align}W&=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\int\left(\vec{E}_1+\vec{E}_2\right)^2\mathrm{d}\tau\notag\\&=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\int\left(E_1^2+E_2^2+2\vec{E}_1\cdot\vec{E}_2\right)\notag\\&=W_1+W_2+\epsilon_0\int\left(\vec{E}_1\cdot\vec{E}_2\right)\mathrm{d}\tau\notag\end{align}$$
For point charges , $W_1,W_2$﻿ represent the energy that fabricates the charges , and $\epsilon_0\int\left(\vec{E}_1\cdot\vec{E}_2\right)\mathrm{d}\tau$﻿ is the interacting energy.
# 4.Conductors
## 4.1 Basic Properties
Free charges:
$$\begin{cases}\text{Metallic conductor: free electrons}\\\text{Liquid conductor: ions}\end{cases}$$
For ideal conductors in electrostatic field , there are some properties:
1. $\vec{E}=0$﻿ inside a conductor.
2. $\rho=0$﻿ inside a conductor.
3. Any net charge resides on the surface.
4. A conductor is an equipotential.
5. $\vec{E}$﻿ is perpendicular to the surface outside the conductor.
## 4.2 Induced Charge
A conductor can isolate the charges inside and outside it because of the induced charges.
For charge outside , it will induce charges on the outer surface of the conductor which offset the electric field produced by the outside charge.
For the point charge in a cavity of a conductor , it will induce charges both on the wall of the cavity and the outer surface. The inner induced charges offset the electric field produced by the point charge out the cavity. And the outer induced charges will distribute on the surface “**normally**”(only depend on the shape of the surface).  
In particularly ,  
$$q_{\text{inner}}=-q,q_{\text{outer}}=q$$
## 4.3 Surface Charge and the Force on a Conductor
Because $\vec{E}_{in}=0$﻿ , applying Boundary Condition
$$\vec{E}_{\text{out}}=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}$$
Let $\vec{f}$﻿ to be the force per unit area the surface experenced
$$\vec{f}=\sigma\cdot\frac{\vec{E}_{\text{in}}+\vec{E}_{\text{out}}}{2}$$
Thus , for a conductor
$$\vec{f}=\frac{\sigma^2}{2\epsilon_0}=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0E^2$$
## 4.4 Capacitors
![[%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87_20240131171137.jpg|300]]
For a system contains two conductors , one charged $+Q$﻿ and another $-Q$﻿
$$V=V_+-V_-=\int_a^b\vec{E}\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{l}$$
Guaranteed by uniqueness theorem , the distribution of the charges is independent of the magnitude $Q$﻿.  
Thus  
$E$﻿ as well as $V$﻿ is proportional to $Q$﻿ , and the constant of the proportionality
$$C=\frac{Q}{V}$$
is called the **capacitance.**
The work to charge the capacitor:
$$W=\frac{Q^2}{2C}=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$$
